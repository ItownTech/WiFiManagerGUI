# WiFiManagerGUI
An ESP8266 / OLED display project for connecting to an Access Point using a GUI.

#Background
There are numerous articles, projects and libraries that set the ESP8266 into Acces Point mode allowing you to connect and configure an SSID and password before restarting the device in Station mode.  These are great but what if you actually have a display attached to the device?  Why can't the device attempt to connect to previously saved settings and if this fails, allow the user to select an Access Point and enter a pasword using a GUI?

#Credits
The inspiration for this project came two separate GitHub projects - Tzapu's amazing [WifiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager) project and Squix78's [esp8266-oled-ssd1306](https://github.com/squix78/esp8266-oled-ssd1306) library for driving these little OLED displays.
